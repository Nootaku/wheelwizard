# Wizard Skating

## Building blocks (essentials)

Even though Wizard Skating can seem pretty intimidating, it fundamentally relies on 6 core moves. To Wizard Skate, it is also advised to use Rockered Skates. Rockered Skates are skates whose center wheels are bigger than the front and back wheels, thus giving 3 balance positions to each foot of the skater.

### Posture

The main posture to learn is called the **Predator**. It aims at optimizing balance and minimizing the resistance while rolling *in a straight line*. The main principles of the Predator are:

1. Use the frame on the center (no edge), with skates and knees shoulder-width apart. Bend the knees an straighten your back keeping your eyes in the direction of the movement.
2. The weight of the body should always be to the opposite direction of the movement (on the center-back wheel if going forwards and on center-front wheel if going backwards)
3. One foot carries (most of) the weight and the other foot will be guiding the direction of the movement.

### 1. The Gazelle

The **Gazelle** is the first building block of Wizard Skating. It consists of a 180° spin during a turn. This 180° spin can be both open or closed. We will tackle the difference in a bit, but make sure that your position is the same when you enter and exit the Gazelle move.

We will start with the **Fakie Gazelle** (or back Gazelle), and more specifically the Open Fakie Gazelle. Here is what 



#### Open vs Closed

The difference between `open` and `closed` is the position of the hips relative to the turn.

- If I were to take a left turn, I could enter the turn with either my left foot forwards. This would put my right foot to the back and force my pelvis to point slightly to the right. This means that my hips would be '*open*' relative to the turn.
- If my right foot would be my leading foot, my pelvis would point to the inside of the turn making it a '*closed*' variation.
